					<h1>Interdisciplinary National conference on Digital Transformation</h1>
					<span>Team Suraksha</span>
					<p>There was an Interdisciplinary National Conference at Surana College on Sept 8, 2016 in which we had participated under the guidance of Asst Prof. Bharatesh Chakravarthi. Our day at the national conference was once in a lifetime and we all feel lucky to have had the opportunity to see what it’s like to put forward an amazing idea and get recognized, appreciated for it. I realized that the work, the performance put in for a particular event is not always easy. As we reached the venue and got in for the registration, the team from the host college talked to us about how they already liked our paper about our project that we would present which was entitled “SURAKSHA”. We got our slots to present the paper and our presentation happened to be the first one in the list which had 15 teams from various other colleges.Before getting into the actual competition we had two rounds. Round one was to send an audio clip of the abstract of our project and round two was to prepare an IEEE format of our project which was the actual task to do. All the hard work paid off and we got through to the final round.
</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, we were guided to the auditorium for the address of speech followed by a photo session and keynote address session by various dignitaries present there. All the speakers had their talks about how India is Digitally Transforming, pros and cons of it. It was time for our presentation and we were confident.</p>
					<p>Aishwarya Nagesh Kamath, our team member represented our team and she kept it simple, confident and understandable. The presentation went really well. The presentation was followed by panel discussion and expert talk. Both the events were really informative and it was an eye opener for building engineers like us to aim trigger, to implement mere of out of the box thinking. All the talks of these achievers had a huge impact on our way of thinking. The biggest lesson that we want to take from all the speakers would be “You have to continue even if you make mistake. Your mistake don’t show who you are-they are just something to learn from and learning must be the life long process”.  Finally, at the end of the day each group had presented to their peers. It had two winners and the time had arrived for the names of the winners to be announced. All four of us were really tensed; we were just clueless what the result would be. The moment they announced our team as the winner we were all on cloud nine, brimming with joy and we were called on the stage, honored with a cash price. It was an amazing experience. We would cherish this for life time. Lastly, the whole achievement was possible solely because of our beloved guide Asst Prof. Bharatesh for having believed in us and pushing us forward with oodles of positivity always.
