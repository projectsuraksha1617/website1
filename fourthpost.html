					<h1>State Level Science Exhibition cum Competition</h1>
					<span>Team Suraksha</span>
					<p> A State Level Science Exhibition cum Competition was held on March 10th 2017 at VTU, Belgaum, in which I, Aishwarya and my teammates Meghana, Hemashri and Pooja participated under the guidance of Asst Prof. Bharatesh Chakravarthi. It was the first time that we would be going there. So we all were very excited to see the campus of the university we belong to. Our bags were packed and we were all set to leave from Bangalore on the previous night.</p>
					<p>The next day morning as we reached the campus, we were welcomed warmly and were told that the competition would be starting around 10am. So by 10am, we were well prepared with everything that we had to present in the competition.</p>
					<p>We got our team registered and we were allotted our slots to present our project. Right before the competition started, there was an inaugural ceremony where, dignitaries from various fields were a part of it namely, Dr. Shivaprasad B. Dandagi, Dr. Mahantesh N. Birje, Dr. H.N. Jagannatha Reddy and Dr. Satish Annigeri . All the speakers spoke about their contributions to the specially abled people through their respective fields.</p>
					<p>Then the competition started very effervescently. The judges were going around from one team to another, listening to their presentation patiently and were trying to comprehend the implementation of each project. Finally this was followed by valedictory. They announced all the names of the winners, who were all well deserving and equally competent.</p>
					<p>The whole event was very well organized by the Center for P.G Studies, VTU, Belgaum. Our day at the competition was once in a lifetime. It was very knowledgeable and inspiring, because the whole theme of the competition was to help the specially abled oneâ€™s through the emerging trends and technologies. We all feel lucky that we were shortlisted as one among the 74 teams to showcase our project on such a huge platform. Overall, it was an amazing experience. Lastly, the whole execution was possible merely because of our beloved guide Prof. Bharatesh for having believed in us and constantly encouraging us at every step.</p>
